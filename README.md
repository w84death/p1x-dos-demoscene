# p1x-dos-intros
Tools for creating intros for (Free)DOS

## Targetted hardware:
 * 486DX2/66Mhz
 * 4MB RAM
 * VGA (Exact card to be decide)

I'm running on an emulated 486DX2/66 for development and runtime. Why exact this hardware? It was my first computer as a kid where I learned to program on QBASIC. I have a grayscale monitor and MS-DOS was the best OS to play games. And it has QBASIC :)

## Open Software:
 * [FreeDOS](https://freedos.org/)
 * [OpenWatcom](https://openwatcom.org/)
 * [FED - Folding Text Editor](https://shawnhargreaves.com/fed/) as IDE
